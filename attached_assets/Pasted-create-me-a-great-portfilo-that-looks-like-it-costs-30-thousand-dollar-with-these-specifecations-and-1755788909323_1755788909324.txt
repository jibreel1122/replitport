Computer Engineering Student
Born and raised in Ramallah - Billin, Palestine, I bring a unique perspective to the world of technology. Currently studying Computer Engineering at Birzeit University, my journey is driven by a passion for innovation and a desire to create meaningful digital experiences.

I specialize in building modern web applications using cutting-edge technologies. I believe in writing clean, maintainable code and creating user interfaces that are both beautiful and functional.

When I'm not coding or studying, you'll find me exploring new technologies, contributing to open-source projects, or sharing knowledge with the developer community.
